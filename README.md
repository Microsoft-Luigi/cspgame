______________PYGAME INSTALLATION_____________________
once you have python installed you can install pygame.
do WINDOWS + R and type in "cmd" to the search area.
in the command prompt, type "pip install pygame"
it should install pygame. 
if you're wondering what "pip" means, I think it means "Python Install Package" or something idk.
to make sure it's installed, type 
"pip list" to the command prompt to see all of the currently installed modules.
